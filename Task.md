# 1.0 Test your understanding of HTML fundamentals.


## Create a simple HTML page that includes the following elements:
### A heading with the text "My Favorite Things".
### An unordered list containing at least three items representing your favorite things.
### An image of one of your favorite things.

Ensure your HTML code is well-structured and correctly uses appropriate tags.



# Apply CSS styles to HTML elements.


## Using you HTML file from Assignment/Task 1(The HTML Task), apply the following styles:

### Set the background color of the page to light blue (#add8e6).

### Center-align the heading text.

### Apply a border around the images with a thickness of 2 pixels and a solid black color.

### Change the font color of the list items to green.

### Increase the font size of the list items to 18 pixels.

Submit the modified HTML file with your applied styles.




# Practice writing JavaScript functions.


## Write JavaScript functions to perform the following tasks:
### Create a function called calculateArea that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns the area.

### Create a function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

### Write a JavaScript function named isEven that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is even (i.e. divisible by 2 without remainder), otherwise returns false.


Test your functions with various inputs to ensure they work correctly.

Submit your JavaScript code containing these functions.
