Title: Express Server and MongoDB Assignment.

Dear Students,
I hope you're all doing well! As part of our recent sessions, we've delved into setting up an Express server, connecting to a MongoDB database, and performing CRUD operations using Mongoose schemas. Now, it's time to put your newfound skills to the test with a hands-on assignment.

Your task is to replicate the steps we followed in our demo but with a different data structure. You'll set up an Express server, establish a connection to a MongoDB database, create Mongoose schemas, and implement CRUD operations for a different entity.
: You have the freedom to choose from any of the four different cases provided below.

1. Product Inventory: Manage a product inventory system with features for getting, adding, updating, and deleting products.

2. Customer Management: Develop a system to manage customer information, with features for getting, adding, updating, and deleting customers.

3. Event Booking: Create an application for booking events or appointments, with features for getting, adding, updating, and deleting event bookings.

4. Employee Directory: Build an employee directory with functionalities for getting, adding, updating, and removing employee profiles.

NOTE: Submit your assignment along with your MongoDB connection string, it should have your username but not your password.
