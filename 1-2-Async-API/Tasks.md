Create an HTML file with a simple structure (e.g., a list of items, a form, etc.).

Write JavaScript code to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in the HTML file.

Implement a functionality using an event to add a new element and change the color of an existing element.



Within a single JavaScript file, make requests to three different endpoints provided by this URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos.

Assuming the structure of each resource in the array is 


{

    "albumId": 1,
"id": 2,
"title": "reprehenderit est deserunt velit ipsam",
"url": "https://via.placeholder.com/600/771796",
"thumbnailUrl": "https://via.placeholder.com/150/771796"
}




Fetch the data from each endpoint.

Display all the fetched data on the frontend.

Each item should be in a card.
